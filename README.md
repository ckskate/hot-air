# Hot Air: The Cooling of Sound
### a project by Connor Killion


## How to run the code/where to look (for the instructors)

The meat and potatoes of this project are contained in the file `app.js`, which
is located in the `js/` folder. There's a lot of other code in there for recording
and drawing the graphics, but I've included comments that should direct you to
the heat diffusion equation part.

To run the visualizer, you can either click [here](https://ckillion.me/hot-air)
in Chrome or Firefox (while running on a 12+ inch screen), or, while in one of
the aforementioned browsers, go to `File` > `Open` and choose `index.html` from
the `hotair` folder.

## About

This repository contains my final project for Computer Simulations in Earth and
Planetary Science, a class in UC Berkeley's EPS department. Powered by the heat
diffusion equation, this tool allows you to construct initial temperature
distributions from the time domain waveforms of 3 second audio clips, and watch
how the heat spreads through the system.
